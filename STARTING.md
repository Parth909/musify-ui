# Steps to Collaborate

- As a member of the organization & member of the **Musify-devs** team u have the ability to pull the code in you folder

1. Make a new folder on your machine then initialize empty git repo \
`git init`

2. Configure you github account on the machine \
`git config --global user.name yourgithubname`\
`git config --global user.email yourgithubemail`
3. Since you have write permissions no need to fork the repo

4. Pull the repo on ur machine\
`git pull https://github.com/Musify-react/musify.git master `

5. Remember you shouldn't directly on the master branch Create ur own feature branch\
`git checkout -b YOURBRANCHNAME`
- Then work on this Branch

6. Do some general configs like\
`git remote add origin https://github.com/Musify-react/musify.git`

7. Modify the files named `tt.js` or `tttt.js` with some gibberish things don't touch other files yet

8. Then do the staging & commiting\
`git add . `\
`git commit -m "Your message while commiting"`

9. Push the changes to github with **YOUR BRANCHNAME ONLY**\
`git push origin YOURBRANCHNAME`

10. Add **Parth909** as your code reviewer otherwise your code won't be added to the repo
Do the following
- Click on Comp & Pull Request
- On the right hand side top corner assign **@Parth909** as the reviewer
- Click on Create the Pull Request

Assigning others or yourself as the reviewer won't work due to the project's organizations policy

# If You Are Not Able To Do Anything Plz Contact Parth909 via whatsapp or call him don't do anything upside down
- Otherwise the structure & branches will be difficult to deal with

# Happy Coding :v:
